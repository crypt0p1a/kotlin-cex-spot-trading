     * Client can place new orders via REST API by using Do My New Order Request. The parameters
     * and samples of such requests are shown in this section.
     *
     * Response message indicates the last up-to-date status of order which is available in the
     * system at the moment of sending the response.
     *
     * If the Client did not receive a Response message to Do My New Order Request -
     * the Client can query current status of the order by using Get My Orders Request with
     * clientOrderId parameter.
     *
     * When sending a request for new order, it is highly recommended to use clientOrderId parameter
     * which corresponds to the specific new order request on the client's side. Spot Trading
     * protects multiple placing of orders with the same clientOrderId for a reasonable period of
     * time.
     *
     * If more than one new orders with identical clientOrderId and other order parameters are
     * identified - Spot Trading places only the first order and returns the status of such order to
     * the Client in response to the second and subsequent new order requests with the same
     * parameters. If orders with identical clientOrderId but with different other order parameters
     * are identified - Spot Trading processes only the first order and rejects the second and
     * subsequent new order requests with the same clientOrderID but with different other order
     * parameters. Nevertheless, if Client creates more than one orders with same clientOrderId in a
     * significant period of time, order with same clientOrderId can be accepted by the system. It's
     * Client's responsibility to control unique indication of clientOrderIds.
     *
     * Order limitations
     * The system has a limit on the number of active (open) orders. By default, Client can have a
     * maximum of 20 active taker orders. Once limit is reached, the system will reject any new
     * orders with a reject reason “Too many active orders” until the total number of active orders
     * is below the limit.
     *
     * Important notice regarding Market orders
     * CEX.IO Spot Trading can partially execute market orders in order to prevent Client's possible
     * loss. Market orders that were executed but not completely filled will have "CANCELED" status.
